# CS 360 Project 1 Part I: The Metacircular Evaluator

Collaborators: Mya Ho

Please put anything else you would like us to know here.

Problem 1 took a good 80 minutes to go over notes/lectures and understand the code, but implementing the functions was easy (around 5 minutes). The rest of the time was spent determining how to implement "error" as a primitive. Problem 2 was also refreshing myself on notes/lecture for a good span of time, but eventually all the bugs were worked out. I estimated a bit for the time spent on Problem 3, but it was a lot of working, researching, and taking breaks. The hints from Thursday's lecture helped a lot in the end. Problem 4 was much shorter thanks to office hours.
